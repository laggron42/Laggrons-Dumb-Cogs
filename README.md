Hello and welcome there, this is the repository for the **Laggron's Dumb Cogs**, a bunch of modules for [Red, the modular Discord bot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/tree/V3/master) version 3. This is using the rewrite of [Discord.py library](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/tree/rewrite).

If you still don't have Red installed, I suggest you to install it [here](https://red-discordbot.readthedocs.io/en/v3-develop/), there's no coding skill required, it's the best bot you can have, it has everything (including the cogs of that repo)!

Please join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/AVzjfpR) to stay tuned about everything, or if you want to ask a question, submit a bug or a suggestion. You can also [submit an issue](https://github.com/retke/Laggrons-Dumb-Cogs/issues/new/choose).
