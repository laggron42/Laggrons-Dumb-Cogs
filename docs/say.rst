    on the repo.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Can I send messages in another channel than the one where I typed the command?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes, by giving the channel as the first argument, like that:

.. code-block:: none
    
    [p]say #my-channel Hello!
    [p]say my-channel Hello!

You can also use the command in DM. 
It is recommended to give the channel ID as argument, since there may be many 
channels that has the same name in the bot servers.

.. code-block:: none

    [p]say 363031186504941578 Hello!

.. tip::
  Get the ID by enabling the developer mode (User settings -> Appearance), then by right-clicking on the channel.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Can I make the bot upload links?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes, just attach a file to your message, 
it will be reposted with the same content. You can also add or not a comment.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Can I make the bot delete my message?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes, there's a command called :ref:`sayd <command-sayd>` (for say delete) that 
will delete your message before posting.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
My bot is slow to delete messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your bot is slow, that is an issue with your discord connection. Try changing
the host machine.

.. tip::
    
    You should use the :ref:`interact <command-interact>` command 
    that let you tell what the bot should say in DM, so users won't see you typing.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I am not allowed to use the command
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The command is only available for server owners and bot owner by default.
You can modify this by using the core permissions cog.
