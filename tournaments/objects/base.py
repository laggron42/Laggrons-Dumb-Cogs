    Parameters
    ----------
    tournament: Tournament
        The match's tournament.
    round: str
        The round of this match in the bracket (e.g. 1 for first round of winner bracket, -1 for
        first round of loser bracket).
    set: str
        The number of the match. Challonge calls this the suggested play order (goes from 1 to N,
        the number of matches in the bracket).
    id: int
        A unique identifier for the API
    underway: bool
        If the match is underway (provided by API)
    player1: Participant
        The first player of this match.
    player2: Participant
        The second player of this match.

    Attributes
    ----------
    tournament: Tournament
        The match's tournament.
    round: str
        The round of this match in the bracket (e.g. 1 for first round of winner bracket, -1 for
        first round of loser bracket).
    set: str
        The number of the match. Challonge calls this the suggested play order (goes from 1 to N,
        the number of matches in the bracket).
    id: int
        A unique identifier for the API
    player1: Participant
        The first player of this match.
    player2: Participant
        The second player of this match.
    channel: Optional[discord.TextChannel]
        The channel for this match. May be `None` if the match hasn't started yet, or if it
        couldn't be created and is therefore in DM.
    start_time: Optional[datetime]
        Start time of this match. `None` if it hasn't started yet.
    end_time: Optional[datetime]
        End time of this match, or time of the latest message. `None` if it hasn't started or
        ended yet. This is updated as soon as a message is sent in the channel. Used for knowing
        when to delete the channel (5 min after last message).
    status: str
        Defines the current state of the match.

        *   ``"pending"``: Waiting to be launched (no channel or stream pending)
        *   ``"ongoing"``: Match started
        *   ``"finished"``: Score set, awaiting channel deletion
    warned: Optional[Union[datetime, bool]]
        Defines if there was a warn for duration. `None` if no warn was sent, `datetime.datetime`
        if there was one first warn sent (correspond to the time when it was send, we rely on that
        to know when to send the second warn), and finally `True` when the second warn is sent
        (to the T.O.s).
    streamer: Optional[Streamer]
        The streamer assigned to this match, if any.
    on_hold: bool
        `True` if the match is not started but on hold, awaiting something (most likely inside a
        stream queue, waiting for its turn)
    is_top8: bool
        `True` if the match is in the top 8 of the tournament
    is_bo5: bool
        `True` if the match is in BO5 format instead of BO3
    round_name: str
        Name of the round (ex: Winner semi-finals, Loser round -2)
    checked_dq: bool
        If we performed AFK checks. Setting this to `True` is possible and will disable further
        AFK checks for this match.

class Tournament:
    """
    Represents a tournament in a guild.

    This object is created as soon as the tournament is setup, and destroyed only once it ends.

    The config is loaded inside and will not be updated unless reloaded.

    This contains all of the methods useful for the tournament, a list of `Participant` and a list
    of `Match`, and a `discord.ext.tasks.Loop` task updating the infos from the bracket.

    This contains the base structure, but no interface with a bracket, this has to be implemented
    later by inheriting from this class and overwriting the abstract methods, allowing multiple
    providers to work with the same structure.

    If you're implementing this for a new provider, the following methods need to be implemented:

    *   `_get_all_rounds`
    *   `_update_match_list`
    *   `_update_participants_list`
    *   `start`
    *   `stop`
    *   `add_participant`
    *   `add_participants`
    *   `destroy_player`
    *   `list_participants`
    *   `list_matches`
    *   `reset`

    And set the following class vars with your other inherited objects for `Participant` and
    `Match` :

    *   `match_object`
    *   `participant_object`

    See ``challonge.py`` for an example.
